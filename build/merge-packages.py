"""Merge target-framework assets from one set of NuGet packages into another.

No single .NET SDK can build net8.0-ios, net9.0-ios and net10.0-ios (or the equivalent -android
triples) together: each SDK's ios/android workload supports only the current target framework and
the previous one. The packages are therefore built in two passes (see BuildNugets.sh) and merged
here into one package per id.

For every package in PRIMARY, any lib/<tfm>/ tree that exists in the matching ADDITIONAL package
but not in PRIMARY is copied across, and the matching <group targetFramework="..."> is lifted out
of ADDITIONAL's nuspec so NuGet advertises the new target framework. Everything else comes from
PRIMARY unchanged.

The dependency group is copied rather than synthesised as an empty one. OpenTok.Net.Android and the
umbrella OpenTok.Net package declare dependencies on their siblings, and an empty group would tell
NuGet that a net10 consumer needs none of them - so OpenTok.Net.Android would restore on net10
without its webrtc/mltransformers dependencies, and the app would fail at runtime with a missing
native symbol instead of at restore time.
